Welcome to the second edition of my DevOps Challenge Series, where we delve into the automation of deploying a Node.js and MongoDB application on an AWS EC2 instance. A unique challenge here is to make the application accessible over the internet on port 3000, all while incorporating the efficiency of automation.

Our tools of choice for this endeavor are Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management. Let's break down the process in a more formal yet straightforward manner.

1. Terraform: Crafting the Foundation
    - Provisioning Infrastructure:
        - Establish key pairs for SSH access.
        - Create a robust security group to regulate traffic.
        - Bring an AWS EC2 instance to life as the hosting platform.
2. Ansible: Orchestrating Configuration
    - Configuring Infrastructure:
        - Install essential system packages and Node.js dependencies.
    - Deploying the Node.js Application:
        - Clone the application repository from GitHub.
        - Install the requisite application dependencies.
        - Initiate the application for public access on port 3000.
        
In essence, Terraform sets the stage by crafting a secure and accessible environment, while Ansible takes charge of fine-tuning the server and deploying our Node.js application seamlessly.

Join me in this DevOps challenge as we transform simplicity into an automated symphony, unlocking the potential for efficient and reliable infrastructure deployment. üöÄüåê
